*Storefront* is a robust and flexible [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) theme, designed and built by the team at [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) to help you make the most out of using the [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com) plugin to power your online store. It's available to download for free from the WordPress [theme repository](https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/).

It features deep integration with WooCommerce core plus several of the most popular extensions:

* [WooCommerce Bookings](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-bookings/)
* [WooCommerce Wishlists](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-wishlists/)
* [WooCommerce Brands](https://woocommerce.com/products/brands/)
* [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/)

For developers, Storefront is the perfect starting point for your project. It's lean and extensible codebase will allow you to easily add functionality to your site via child theme and/or custom plugin(s).

## Storefront extensions
Looking to take your storefront powered store to the next level? Be sure to checkout the premium [Storefront extensions](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/storefront-extensions/).

## Storefront Documentation
You can view detailed Storefront documentation on the [WooCommerce documentation website](https://docs.woocommerce.com/documentation/themes/storefront/).

## Storefront in your language
Storefront translations can be downloaded from [WordPress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-themes/storefront). To use one of these translations it is recommended that you upload it to `wp-content/languages/themes/storefront-pt_BR.mo`. Adding it to this location means the file will not be lost when you update Storefront. It is however possible to add a translation to the `languages` folder in your child theme if you'd prefer.

## Storefront help & support
WooCommerce customers can get support at the [WooCommerce support portal](https://woocommerce.com/contact-us/). Otherwise, you can try posting on the [WordPress support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/theme/storefront/). Please remember, GitHub is for bug reports and contributions, _not_ support.
