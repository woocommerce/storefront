Resetting and rebuilding styles have been helped along thanks to the fine work of
Eric Meyer http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/index.html
along with Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/

All sizing (typography, layout, padding/margins etc) are inspired by a modular scale that uses 12px/14px as base sizes with a 1.618 ratio.
We use the excellent modular scale tool built by Tim Brown to calculate this. http://modularscale.com/scale/?px1=14&px2=12&ra1=1.618&ra2=0
