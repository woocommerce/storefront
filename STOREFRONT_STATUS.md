# Status of Storefront

> **tl;dr:** Storefront is in active development and we’ll continue to improve it alongside priorities like the new optimised checkout.

Storefront continues to be a theme that powers a significant number of WooCommerce stores in the ecosystem and we continue to invest active development time that ensures Storefront remains a valuable resource for the ecosystem. On the horizon there are a number of transitions happening in the WordPress theme industry and in order to be prepared as a team we are also prioritizing and investing in experimenting with and building new features to support this direction that ultimately benefits WooCommerce stores, merchants and shoppers.

To that end, to bring clarity to what we are prioritizing for active Storefront development, we’ve created this criteria list. Our engineers are using this list to help us effectively triage issues. Going forward, we will only be actively addressing issues that fall in one of these criteria “buckets”:

- Contribute to improving our release processes or documentation.
- Critical bugs that break expected functionality for important flows in a store (eg. Checkout flow). This also includes security related issues that require immediate release after fixing.
- Non critical  bugs that are still affecting a significant number of merchants or stores but don’t break critical flows (including those related to accessibility or internationalisation). 
- Address significant compatibility issues with any one of: WordPress core updates, WooCommerce core updates, or signature products important to be compatible with (such as WooCommerce Blocks).

At this time, most enhancements and features will not be worked on and in order to be clear about expectations we will be generally closing issues unless they fall into one of the above buckets.

While we also welcome contributions (pull requests) from the community. There is still an investment of time needed by our team to review the prs and consider the impact of merging to Storefront. So at this time, unless a pull request falls into one of the above buckets, we will be closing it.
